      <p>In this post I want to share my personal experience with the
<a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> project. If you don't know Gitea in a self-hosted
alternative to Github.</p>
<p id="zola-continue-reading"><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>I've always liked the idea of <strong>owning my own stuff</strong>, for this reason I had
already played a bit with a private Gitlab installation. However this Gitlab
episode left me with some really deep scars. Of course, most of the problems I
faced were only my own fault... Who would've though that installing Gitlab on a
server with <strong>only 512Mb of RAM</strong> was a bad idea? Not my younger self, that's
for sure. In my defence, at the time the minimum was <strong>only</strong> 2Gb.</p>
<p>Given my previous experience I was really hopeful: &quot;At least it <strong>can't</strong> be
worse than Gitlab&quot; I though to myself. And for once I was right. What I couldn't
anticipate was how good Gitea was.</p>
<p>Before we continue I want to make a few points about the things I would have to
consider before deciding for or against Gitea. First, I want something I can
run with much less than 512Mb of RAM. This is because I plan to run the service
inside an US$5 instance on Linode that I already have for other projects;
Second, I want something that once properly configured, works without any kind
of intervention; Lastly I already had a great amount of headache with Django
installations, so something easy to install would be a really nice bonus.</p>
<p>At a first glance I saw in theirs website <strong>&quot;Easy to install&quot;</strong> and
<strong>&quot;Lightweight&quot;</strong>. That was enough to make me install it in my server.
Installation was a breeze. Just download the binary, copy a sample config file
and run the binary. After that I just needed to make some small tweaks in
my configuration file, create an appropriate location to hold my data and
create a systemd unit file. This setup was made way back in 2017 and it just
works.</p>
<p>I am aware that part of my good experience stems from me no pushing the
software hard enough. My use is <strong>really</strong> light, I mostly use it as a backup
for source code that I don't want to put on Github.</p>
<p>Having said all that, if you want something that is stable, easy to configure and
can be deployed to basically anything; I really think you should give Gitea a
chance. After almost 2 years my only <strong>real</strong> complain is their name, because I am
still unable to properly pronounce it...</p>
<p>PS: Just to be clear, I don't think that Gitlab is a bad piece of software. It
just wasn't made for my use case. It was made to compete with Github inside big
corporations with complex needs and in this environment I do think that Gitlab
is a big feat of engineering. The problem was that I took something made for
the enterprise and tried to use it at home.</p>
