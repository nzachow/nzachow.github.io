      <p>This is a list with some Youtube channels that I like to watch.</p>
<p id="zola-continue-reading"><a name="continue-reading"></a></p>
<p>They aren't arranged in any particular order.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc">Ben Eater</a> he has a series where he built
an 8-bit computer in a breadboard. This is better than some books on computer
architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/featony">This Old Tony</a> is an extremely skilled and
funny machinist. He has a series where he built a kart for his son with mostly
scrap parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/submarineboat">SV Seeker</a> Doug is building a GIANT
boat in his backyard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MetalJesusRocks">MetalJesusRocks</a> The Metal Jesus
is a long-haired rocker dude who runs a channel dedicated to Retro Gaming with
a Heavy Metal soundtrack. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChemlife">The Thought Emporium</a> I'll just paste
here his own description from Youtube:</p>
<p>When we think of science and scientists, we tend to think of people in perfect
white lab coats, working in a shiny and expensive lab. Well I'm here to break
that image. From biohacking and biology, to nuclear physics and nanotech, any
topic is fair game. I don't just talk about concept and theory, I do the real
science. Under controlled conditions, I'll use high voltage, corrosive
solutions, extreme temperatures and more to create some very exciting machines
and materials. Best of all, I'll show all of it can be done at home using as
many off the shelf and DIY parts as possible.</p>
